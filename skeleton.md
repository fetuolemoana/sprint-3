## What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. ##
The columns collapse and move below one another when the screen is made smaller than 550 px.

## How do you think that works? ##
The above result is a feature of a website that is responsive. Percentages rather than pixels are used to determine the size of columns and media queries (@media) can be used to specify how much space (percentage) columns should take up as a screen size changes.
