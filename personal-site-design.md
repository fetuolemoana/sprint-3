# Personal site design
**What is your site's primary purpose?**

To demonstrate and achieve the requirements of the Dev Academy Phase-0 programme.

**Who is your target audience?**

My target audiences are my Horoeka cohortians and those monitoring my performance from Dev Academy.

**How do you want visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?**

I would like both my fellow cohortians to navigate to the info they want with ease. I want to inspire happy motivated thoughts. I want them to feel like we are working together. In regards to Dev Academy staff monitoring my performance I want to __clearly__ show how I have implemented each sprint. 

**How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?**

I will consider some of the learning on user experience and responsive design. Also, I am thinking of ways that my website can support the collective learning and relationships of myself and team. I might plan for a page dedicated to my Horoeka whanau which will link to and tautoko their awesome pages too.
